Optimal Real-Time Bidding for Display Advertising
===========

A benchmarking framework supporting the experiments of real-time bidding optimisation. A description of such problem and benchmarking experiment is [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7073).

In the current version, we implemented the feature engineering for logistic regression CTR estimator and standard bidding functions as described in the above reference. The state-of-the-art bidding function proposed in KDD'14 paper [Optimal Real-Time Bidding for Display Advertising](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/w.zhang/papers/ortb-kdd.pdf) is planned to be published here in Dec. 2014.

For any problems, please report the issues here or contact [Weinan Zhang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/w.zhang/).

### Feature Engineering Code
Please check our GitHub project [make-ipinyou-data](https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data). After downloading the dataset, by simplying `make all` you can generate the standardised data which will be used in the bid optimisation tasks.

### Run Bid Optimisation
After successfully generating the data, let's suppose `make-ipinyou-data` project is placed in the same folder of `optimal-rtb` project, just like this:
```
weinan@ZHANG:~/Project$ ls
optimal-rtb    make-ipinyou-data
```
Then under `optimal-rtb/scripts/` you can simply run `bash demo.sh` to train a logistic regression CTR estimator for one campaign data generated in `make-ipinyou-data` and then perform several bid optimisation algorithms with different parameters.

After running the demo, you could find a file `results/rtb.results.1458.best.perf.tsv` containing the best performance for each bidding algorithm.

Here 'prop' means the proportion between the original cost in the test data and the set budget in the test environment. See [our benchmarking paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7073) for details.

### Misc
The code implementation of generating features has a little difference between that in [our benchmarking paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7073): in the orginal dataset, there could be multiple click events for one impression event. In the benchmarking paper, the multiple clicks are directly counted as the number is. In the `make-ipinyou-data` project, we only count for 1 click even if there are more than one clicks.
