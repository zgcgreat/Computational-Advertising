        To place a bid the target of this callback should call the doBid
        function with the id and the bids object. The router is in charge of
        enforcing the time constraint and will raise either the onTooLate or the
        onDroppedBid callback to notify the agent of late or missing bids.

        Note that it's recomended to always call the doBid function even if no
        bids are to be placed. Doing so will allow the router to resolve
        auctions more quickly and will therefor improve overall performances.

        Once the bids have been placed, one of the ResultCbFn callbacks will be
        triggered asynchronously to notify the agent of the result of the
        bid. In the case of a win, one of the DeliveryCbFn callbacks will be
        triggered asynchronously to notify the agent of delivery events. Note
        that it's possible for delivery callbacks to be triggered for an auction
        before its respective ResultCbFn callback.

        Note that bid results and delivery events will be triggered once per
        impression that was bid on. As an example, if we bid on 3 impressions in
        an auction with 5 available impressions then we will receive 3 bid
        result notification.
